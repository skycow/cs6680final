Phase II update

For phase II I have implemented about 80% of the code from the paper in matlab. This includes the cropping of the region of interest, converting to grayscale, thresholding, and applying the Hough transform. I also acquired video data that seems to be of good quality and have been using that for testing the code and algorithm so far.
